This is the Project of Team 4. (Park simon, Park yubin, Park jumi, Ryu seungjae)

The goal of this project is making the music settop box for small markets who want to play the music in their market.

To clear this problem, Problem solution finding has been started.

The main Topic of this problem is these.

- User need

1. This Product should be targeted to small markets who can't prepare theit own PC because of cost problem.
2. Nice design matched with markets background.
3. Also it is really important to select songs matched with markets atmosphere.
(But number 3 is slightly different from this Project problem.) / (It is related with Big data and music tech)
